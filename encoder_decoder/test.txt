And they just renovated the waiting room .
It looks a lot better than it did in previous years .
Never going back .
They seem overpriced , too .
Friendly staff , same starbucks fair you get anywhere else .
Sometimes the lines can get long .
The food is good .
Unfortunately the service is very hit or miss .
